Table Schemas: Import schemas from @qco/db/schema, e.g., import { Category, ProductCategory } from "@qco/db/schema";.
Drizzle ORM: Import functions like eq, sql from @qco/db, e.g., import { eq, sql } from "@qco/db";.
tRPC Routes: 
- Use ctx for database access in tRPC routes to ensure consistent data handling
- Each router should be in its own directory (e.g., src/routers/products/, src/routers/orders/)
- Each route method should be in a separate file:
  ```
  src/routers/products/
  ├── index.ts           # Router definition and exports
  ├── create.ts          # POST /products
  ├── get-by-id.ts      # GET /products/:id
  ├── get-all.ts        # GET /products
  └── update.ts         # PUT /products/:id
  ```
Validation: Use Zod for input and output validation, importing from @qco/web-validators.
